<p>My Brother, in the Courtyard<br/>Each one of us has stood<br/>Outside the tyled Temple door<br/>Awaiting as we should.</p>


<p>Take heed, thou young Apprentices<br/>The Word emblazoned there:<br/>To meet upon the level<br/>And part upon the square.</p>


<p>My Brother, at the Altar<br/>Each one of us has knelt<br/>With solemn Oath and Brotherhood<br/>The Mystic Tie we've felt.</p>


<p>Take heed, my Brother Fellowcraft<br/>The Word emblazoned there:<br/>To act upon the plumb<br/>And part upon the Square.</p>


<p>My Brother, in the Temple<br/>Each one of us was Raised<br/>And on receiving further light<br/>Into the Light, we gazed.</p>


<p>Take heed, my Brothers, Masters all<br/>The Word emblazoned there:<br/>To Live within the compass<br/>And part upon the Square.<br/><br/>- Author unknown</p>
