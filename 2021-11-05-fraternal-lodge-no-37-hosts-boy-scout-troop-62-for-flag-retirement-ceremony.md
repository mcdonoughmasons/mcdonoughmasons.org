<h1><strong>Retiring Old Glory</strong></h1>


<p>(McDonough, GA - November 4, 2021) The Officers of Fraternal Lodge No. 37 invited Boy Scout Troop 62 to present a U.S. flag retirement ceremony before the evening's meeting. After burgers and hotdogs were served, the ceremony took place in the lodge parking lot with several Brethren in attendance. Many brought their retired flags for the event and each flag was properly and respectfully retired by fire. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When the United States flag (Old Glory) becomes worn, torn, faded or badly soiled, it is time to replace it with a new flag, and the old flag should be "retired" with all the dignity and respect befitting our nation's flag. The traditional method of retirement is to incinerate the flag, but this does not mean that one should simply drop the entire flag (intact) into a fire.</p><p>A flag ceases to be a flag when it is cut into pieces. In addition, it is easier to completely incinerate the flag, if it is cut into smaller pieces. A flag should never be torn up like an old bed sheet. It should be cut up with scissors or shears in a methodical manner. The corners of the flag should be stretched out over a table top and someone should cut the flag in half, vertically (be careful not to cut up the blue star field (see the figure). Then, place the two halves together and cut them in half, horizontally. You will end up with four pieces of flag, one being the blue star field.</p><p>The reason we do not cut the blue star field is it represents the union of the fifty states and one should never let the union be broken.</p><cite><a href="http://usscouts.org/ceremony/flagret1.asp" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="http://usscouts.org/ceremony/flagret1.asp">U.S. Scouting Service Project</a></cite></blockquote>
