<p class="has-normal-font-size">An old man going a lone highway,<br/>Came, at the evening cold and gray,<br/>To a chasm vast and deep and wide.<br/>Through which was flowing a sullen tide<br/>The old man crossed in the twilight dim,<br/>The sullen stream had no fear for him;<br/>But he turned when safe on the other side<br/>And built a bridge to span the tide.<br/><br/>“Old man,” said a fellow pilgrim near,<br/>“You are wasting your strength with building here;<br/>Your journey will end with the ending day,<br/>You never again will pass this way;<br/>You’ve crossed the chasm, deep and wide,<br/>Why build this bridge at evening tide?”<br/><br/>The builder lifted his old gray head;<br/>“Good friend, in the path I have come,” he said,<br/>“There followed after me to-day<br/>A youth whose feet must pass this way.<br/>This chasm that has been as naught to me<br/>To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;<br/>He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;<br/>Good friend, I am building this bridge for him!”</p>
