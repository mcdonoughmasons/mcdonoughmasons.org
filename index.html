        <p>
          Founded in 1844, Fraternal Lodge No.&nbsp;37 is a community of men
          dedicated to building themselves and their world through
          brotherly love, relief and truth. Under the leadership of
          Worshipful Master Jim Robinson, we seek to preserve nearly two
          centuries of tradition while embracing modern tools, to promote
          education, practice charity and leave the world better than we
          found it【947730938655990†L1070-L1082】.

        <h2>What is Freemasonry?</h2>
        <p>
          Freemasonry is more than an ancient fraternity &mdash; it’s a journey
          of self‑discovery. Men of honor and integrity meet in our lodge to
          become better husbands, fathers and citizens while giving back to
          the communities they love. The craft encourages self‑reflection
          and service, helping us to practice the values of equality, hope
          and charity【947730938655990†L1098-L1107】.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Our lodge is part of an institution whose roots reach back to
          medieval stonemasons and cathedral builders. Freemasonry is the
          oldest fraternal organization in the world, and Georgia
          freemasons trace their beginnings to between 1730 and 1734. The
          Grand Lodge of Georgia was formally organized on December&nbsp;16,
          1786【947730938655990†L1124-L1133】. Today, nearly 180 years after our charter,
          Fraternal Lodge No.&nbsp;37 continues to uphold those traditions of
          excellence and service.

              In this moving poem by Will Allen Dromgoole, an old man
              builds a bridge across a chasm for those who follow,
              reminding us that Past Masters laid the groundwork for the
