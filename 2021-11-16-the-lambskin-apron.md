<p>It is not ornamental, the cost is not great,<br/>There are other things far more useful, yet truly I state,<br/>Tho of all my possessions, there's none can compare,<br/>With that white leather apron, which all Masons wear.<br/><br/>As a young lad, I wondered just what it all meant,<br/>When Dad hustled around, and so much time was spent<br/>On shaving and dressing and looking just right,<br/>Until Mother would say: "It's the Masons tonight."<br/><br/>And some winter nights she said: "What makes you go,<br/>Way up there tonight thru the sleet and the snow,<br/>You see the same things every month of the year."<br/>Then Dad would reply: "Yes, I know it, my dear."<br/><br/>Forty years I have seen the same things, it is true.<br/>And though they are old, they always seem new,<br/>For the hands that I clasp, and the friends that I greet,<br/>Seem a little bit closer each time that we meet."<br/><br/>Years later I stood at that very same door,<br/>With good men and true who had entered before,<br/>I knelt at the altar, and there I was taught<br/>That virtue and honor can never be bought.<br/><br/>That the spotless white lambskin all Masons revere,<br/>If worthily worn grows more precious each year,<br/>That service to others brings blessings untold,<br/>That man may be poor tho surrounded by gold.<br/><br/>I learned that true brotherhood flourishes there,<br/>That enmities fade 'neath the compass and square,<br/>That wealth and position are all thrust aside,<br/>As they're on the level men meet and abide.<br/><br/>So, honor the lambskin, may it always remain<br/>Forever unblemished, and free from all stains,<br/>And when we are called to the Great Father's love,<br/>May we all take our place in that Lodge up above</p>
