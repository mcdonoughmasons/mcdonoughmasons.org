<p>Please welcome our newly obligated Entered Apprentice Brethren. </p>


<p>Thanks to all who helped confer the degree to these worthy, well-qualified men. </p>


<p>We had a wonderful turnout and look forward to seeing these Brothers progress through their degrees in the coming months. Their Masonic journey has only begun!</p>
