<p>The Little Lodge of long ago-<br/>It wasn't very much for show;<br/>Men met above the village store,<br/>And cotton more than satin wore,<br/>And sometimes stumbled on a word,<br/>But no one cared, or no one heard.<br/>Then tin reflectors threw the light<br/>Of kerosene across the night<br/>And down the highway served to call<br/>The faithful to Masonic Hall.<br/>It wasn't very much, I know,<br/>The little lodge of long ago.</p>


<p>But, men who meet in finer halls,<br/>Forgive me if the mind recalls<br/>With love, not laughter, doors of pine,<br/>And smoky lamps that dimly shine,<br/>Regalia tarnished, garments frayed,<br/>Or cheaply bought or simply made,<br/>And floors uncarpeted, and men<br/>Whose grammar falters now and then-<br/>For Craft or Creed, or God Himself,<br/>Is not a book upon a shelf:<br/>They have a splendor that will touch<br/>A Lodge that isn't very much.</p>


<p>It isn't very much- and yet<br/>And, if a handful or a host,<br/>This made it great: there Masons met-<br/>That always matters, matters most.<br/>The beauty of the meeting hour<br/>Is not a thing of robe or flow'r,<br/>However beautiful they seem:<br/>The greatest beauty is the gleam<br/>Of sympathy in honest eyes.<br/>A Lodge is not a thing of size,<br/>It is a thing of Brotherhood,<br/>And that alone can make it good.</p>
