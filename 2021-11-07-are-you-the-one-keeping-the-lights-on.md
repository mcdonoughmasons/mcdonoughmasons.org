<p>I know there is someone at the Lodge,<br/>There’s a meeting there twice a month.<br/>I know someone cuts the grass,<br/>I can tell because it gets done;<br/>I know someone pays the lights and water,<br/>Because I see them on each month.<br/>I know someone repairs the building;<br/>Because I see it happen when needed.<br/>I know someone teaches the work;<br/>Because candidates go through.<br/>I know someone sends in the reports;<br/>Because the Lodge keeps its charter.<br/>I know someone keeps things going;<br/>I’d like to help but don’t have time.<br/>I’ll let them do it,<br/>They seem to always be around.<br/>I’ll just wear my ring;<br/>And pay my dues.<br/>When others ask about the Lodge;<br/>I’ll proudly say I’m a member.<br/>And I’ll just let someone else,<br/>Do all the things that keep it going.<br/>Sometimes, though, I wonder...</p>


<p><strong>Who is that someone?</strong></p>
